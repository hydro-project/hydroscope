# ResizeObserver Fix Test Instructions

## What was Fixed

The ResizeObserver loop errors were caused by cascading update cycles between multiple ResizeObserver instances:

1. **FlowGraph Component**: Now uses a safe ResizeObserver hook with:
   - Debouncing (300ms delay)
   - Size change threshold (minimum 2px change)
   - State protection (prevents during layout operations)
   - Stable component lifecycle (no re-mounting)

2. **Error Suppression**: Added targeted error handler that suppresses only ResizeObserver loop errors while preserving other error reporting

3. **Circuit Breaker**: Layout operations are limited to prevent runaway refresh cycles

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```

2. **Test Container Expand/Collapse**:
   - Click on any collapsed container node to expand it
   - Verify: No "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications" errors in console
   - The expand operation should work smoothly without browser errors

3. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   [ResizeObserverErrorHandler] Installed error handler
   [FlowGraph] üöÄ Setting up safe resize observation
   [FlowGraphController] üñ±Ô∏è Node clicked: {nodeId: '...', ...}
   [FlowGraphController] üì¶ Container node clicked: {containerId: '...', ...}
   ```

4. **Verify Error Suppression**:
   - If any ResizeObserver errors still occur from ReactFlow itself, they should be suppressed
   - Look for messages like: `[ResizeObserverErrorHandler] Suppressed ResizeObserver loop error #1`

## Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Before Fix**: ResizeObserver errors crashed expansion operations  
‚úÖ **After Fix**: Smooth container expand/collapse without browser errors  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Benign ResizeObserver loops are suppressed, other errors preserved  
‚úÖ **Performance**: Circuit breaker prevents runaway layout operations  

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for any remaining ResizeObserver messages
2. Verify the FlowGraph setup messages appear (indicates proper component mounting)
3. Look for circuit breaker messages if layouts seem slow
4. Test different container nodes to ensure consistency

The fix addresses the root cause (cascading ResizeObserver loops) while providing safety nets (error suppression) for external ResizeObserver instances we don't control.
