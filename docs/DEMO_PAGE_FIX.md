# Fixed ResizeObserver Error Conflict

## Problem Identified

The ResizeObserver error overlay issue was caused by **conflicting error suppression** between:

1. **Demo Page** (`../hydro/docs/src/pages/hydroscope.js`): Comprehensive error suppression overriding `console.error`, `console.warn`, `window.onerror`, and `window.onunhandledrejection`

2. **Hydroscope Component**: Aggressive global error suppression installed at module load

3. **Webpack Dev Server**: Error overlay system that hooks into errors before they can be suppressed

## Root Cause

Both error suppression systems were fighting each other and interfering with webpack dev server's error overlay mechanism, causing the red error popup to persist despite successful error suppression.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Demo Page** (`hydroscope.js` in this workspace)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Removed global error handler overrides** that conflict with webpack dev server
- ✅ **Kept console.error filtering** for cleaner console output
- ✅ **Allow webpack dev server to handle errors properly** 
- ✅ **Added suppression logging** for debugging

**Key Change:**
```javascript
// OLD: Override window.onerror and window.onunhandledrejection (conflicts with webpack)
// NEW: Only filter console.error output (preserves webpack dev server functionality)

console.error = (...args) => {
  if (args[0].includes('ResizeObserver loop completed')) {
    // Log suppression but let webpack handle the error
    console.info(`[Hydroscope Demo] Suppressed ResizeObserver console error #${count}`);
    return; 
  }
  originalConsoleError.apply(console, args);
};
```

### 2. **Simplified Hydroscope Component Error Handling**

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Removed aggressive module-level global suppression**
- ✅ **Simplified to basic window.onerror handling only**
- ✅ **Removed event listener conflicts**
- ✅ **Maintained layout lock and circuit breaker functionality**

## Files to Copy Back

**Copy this file to:**
```
/Users/jmhwork/code/hydro/docs/src/pages/hydroscope.js
```

**Source:** `/Users/jmhwork/code/hydroscope/hydroscope.js`

## Expected Results

✅ **No More Red Error Overlay** - Webpack dev server can handle errors properly  
✅ **Clean Console Output** - ResizeObserver errors still suppressed from console  
✅ **Smooth Container Operations** - Layout lock prevents race conditions  
✅ **Consistent Edge Rendering** - Sequential operations ensure proper state  
✅ **Better Development Experience** - No conflicts between error handling systems  

## Testing

1. Copy the updated `hydroscope.js` to the demo project
2. Test container expand/collapse operations  
3. Verify no red webpack error overlay appears
4. Check console for suppression messages instead of errors
5. Confirm edges render consistently

The key insight was that webpack dev server needs to see the ResizeObserver errors to handle them properly - completely suppressing them caused the overlay system to malfunction. The new approach filters console output while preserving webpack's error handling flow.
