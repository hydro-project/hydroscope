# Edge Styling Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Custom Markers
- Created `EdgeMarkers.tsx` with custom marker components
- Markers are perpendicular to target nodes based on `targetPosition`
- Markers positioned at node boundaries
- Edge paths shortened to end at marker base
- Marker types: triangle-open, triangle-filled, circle-filled, diamond-open

### 2. Halo Fade Effect
- Halos fade in last 25 pixels before marker
- Fade calculated based on actual SVG path length
- Gradient direction adjusted for edges going right-to-left or bottom-to-top
- No trimming needed - halos fade naturally

### 3. Edge Styling
- Wavy edges work with all path types (straight, bezier, smoothstep)
- Double lines with proper offset
- Halos with gradient fade
- All combinations supported

## Known Issues

### 1. Black Frame Around Expanded Containers
**Status**: Investigating
- Appears as black rounded rectangle inside blue container border
- Not from our edge styling changes
- Likely pre-existing issue or rendering artifact
- Need to inspect actual DOM to identify source

### 2. Double-Wavy Combination Appears Solid
**Issue**: When double lines + wavy are combined, the two wavy lines are so close they appear as one thick solid line

**Suggested Solutions**:
1. **Increase double-line offset for wavy edges**
   - Current offset: ~2-3px
   - Suggested: 4-6px for wavy edges to show gap between waves
   
2. **Phase-shift the waves**
   - Offset one wave by half a wavelength so peaks/troughs don't align
   - Creates visual separation even with close spacing
   
3. **Different wave amplitudes**
   - Make one line more wavy than the other
   - Creates visual distinction

4. **Reduce wave amplitude for double lines**
   - Smaller waves = less overlap
   - Maintains double-line appearance

**Recommended**: Combination of #1 and #2 - increase offset AND phase-shift waves
