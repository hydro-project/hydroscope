# Option A Implementation: performSearchWithExpansion

## Summary
Implemented a consolidated search operation in AsyncCoordinator that handles the entire search pipeline atomically, eliminating race conditions and ResizeObserver errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. AsyncCoordinator.ts - New `performSearchWithExpansion` Method

**Public Method:**
```typescript
async performSearchWithExpansion(
  state: VisualizationState,
  query: string,
  options?: {
    navigateToFirst?: boolean;
    fitView?: boolean;
    timeout?: number;
    maxRetries?: number;
  }
): Promise<SearchResult[]>
```

**Private Handler:**
```typescript
private async _handleSearchWithExpansion(
  state: VisualizationState,
  query: string,
  options?: {
    navigateToFirst?: boolean;
    fitView?: boolean;
  }
): Promise<SearchResult[]>
```

**Pipeline Steps (all in single queued operation):**
1. Perform search (synchronous)
2. Find containers to expand
3. Expand containers (layout + render)
4. Update highlights after expansion
5. Render to apply highlights
6. Navigate to first result (if requested)

### 2. Hydroscope.tsx - Simplified Search Handling

**Before (~100 lines):**
- Complex orchestration with multiple awaits
- Manual container expansion logic
- Separate highlight updates
- Multiple render calls
- Error handling scattered throughout

**After (~10 lines):**
```typescript
await asyncCoordinator.performSearchWithExpansion(
  currentVisualizationState,
  query,
  {
    navigateToFirst: true,
    fitView: false,
  },
);
```

### 3. types/core.ts - Added Operation Type

Added `"search_with_expansion"` to the `QueuedOperation` type union.

## Benefits

✅ **Single queued operation** - Entire search pipeline runs atomically
✅ **No race conditions** - All async boundaries managed by queue
✅ **Eliminates ResizeObserver errors** - Controlled sequencing of DOM mutations
✅ **Simpler component code** - 90% reduction in search handling code
✅ **Better error handling** - Single try/catch for entire operation
✅ **Easier to test** - One method instead of complex flow
✅ **Consistent with existing patterns** - Follows AsyncCoordinator design
✅ **Better logging** - Comprehensive operation tracking

## Architecture Improvements

### Before
```
Hydroscope.tsx (Component)
  ├─ performSearch() → VisualizationState
  ├─ Find containers to expand
  ├─ await expandContainers() → AsyncCoordinator → Queue
  ├─ updateGraphSearchHighlights() → VisualizationState
  ├─ await executeLayoutAndRenderPipeline() → AsyncCoordinator → Queue
  └─ await navigateToElement() → AsyncCoordinator → Queue
```

**Problems:**
- Multiple async boundaries
- State mutations between awaits
- Race conditions possible
- ResizeObserver errors from rapid renders

### After
```
Hydroscope.tsx (Component)
  └─ await performSearchWithExpansion() → AsyncCoordinator → Queue
       └─ _handleSearchWithExpansion()
            ├─ performSearch()
            ├─ Find containers
            ├─ _handleExpandContainers()
            ├─ updateGraphSearchHighlights()
            ├─ _handleLayoutAndRenderPipeline()
            └─ _handleFocusViewportOnElement()
```

**Benefits:**
- Single async boundary
- All state mutations within queued operation
- No race conditions
- Controlled render sequencing

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Load a graph with collapsed containers
2. Search for "map" (or any term with many matches)
3. Observe:
   - ✅ No ResizeObserver errors
   - ✅ All matching nodes highlighted
   - ✅ Viewport focuses on first result
   - ✅ Smooth animation
   - ✅ Comprehensive logging in console

## Logging

The implementation includes detailed logging:
- `🔍 Starting search with expansion operation`
- `🔍 Search completed` (with results count)
- `📦 Containers to expand` (with count)
- `🎨 Updating highlights after expansion`
- `🎯 Navigating to first result`
- `✅ Search with expansion completed successfully`

## Performance

Expected improvements:
- **Fewer renders**: Controlled sequencing prevents extra renders
- **Better caching**: Single operation can be cached/retried as unit
- **Reduced jank**: No intermediate React re-renders
- **Faster execution**: Less overhead from multiple queue operations

## Future Enhancements

This pattern can be extended to other complex operations:
- `performNavigationWithExpansion` - Navigate + expand ancestors
- `performFilterWithLayout` - Filter + relayout + render
- `performBulkOperations` - Multiple operations as single unit

## Code Cleanup

Once confirmed working, we can:
1. Remove debug logging from VisualizationState
2. Remove unused `skipFinalRender` option (no longer needed)
3. Document the pattern for future operations
4. Add unit tests for the new method
