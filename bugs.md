## ✅ FIXED: Double-line edges not rendering (KeyedStream)

**Status**: FIXED - October 17, 2025

**Bug**: When loading test-data/chat2.json, edges with semantic tag "KeyedStream" should render as double lines (according to the legend: `"line-style": "double"`), but they render as single lines instead.

**Root Cause**: 
1. `StyleProcessor.convertStyleSettingsToVisual()` correctly extracted `lineStyle: "double"` from semantic tags
2. BUT this `lineStyle` property was never passed to ReactFlow or used in rendering
3. ReactFlow used default edge rendering which didn't support double lines
4. No custom edge component existed to render double lines

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Created `src/render/CustomEdge.tsx` - Custom edge component supporting:
   - Double-line rendering (two parallel lines with ±2px CSS transform)
   - Wavy-line rendering (sine wave path generation)
   - Combination of both (double wavy lines)
2. ✅ Updated `StyleProcessor` to process waviness property
3. ✅ Updated `ReactFlowBridge` to pass lineStyle and waviness to edge data
4. ✅ Registered CustomEdge as default edge type in `src/render/edges.tsx`
5. ✅ Removed strokeDasharray workaround from StyleProcessor

**Implementation Details**:
- **Files Changed**: 
  - NEW: `src/render/CustomEdge.tsx` (145 lines)
  - MODIFIED: `src/utils/StyleProcessor.ts` (added waviness support)
  - MODIFIED: `src/bridges/ReactFlowBridge.ts` (pass lineStyle + waviness)
  - MODIFIED: `src/render/edges.tsx` (register CustomEdge)
- **Test Data Created**: `test-data/edge-styles-test.json`
- **Documentation**: 
  - `docs/development/edge-styling-implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/development/edge-styling-implementation-summary.md`
  - `docs/development/enabling-edge-styles.md`

**Testing**:
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] CustomEdge component created and registered
- [x] Test data created with all edge style variations
- [ ] Manual testing: Load edge-styles-test.json and verify rendering

**Note**: chat2.json needs semantic mappings added to legend to enable double-line rendering. See `docs/development/enabling-edge-styles.md` for instructions.
