# AsyncCoordinator Error Handling Tests

## Overview

This test suite verifies that the AsyncCoordinator properly handles errors and Promise rejections in all scenarios, ensuring robust error propagation and memory cleanup.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Timeout Error Propagation (4 tests)
- ✅ Timeout errors propagate to callers via Promise rejection
- ✅ Multiple concurrent operations can all timeout independently
- ✅ Timeout error messages include operation details and timeout duration
- ✅ Subsequent operations continue processing after a timeout

### 2. Retry Exhaustion Error Propagation (4 tests)
- ✅ Errors propagate to callers after all retries are exhausted
- ✅ Multiple operations can fail independently with proper retry counts
- ✅ Error messages include the original error details
- ✅ Queue continues processing after retry exhaustion

### 3. Failed Operations Don't Block Queue (4 tests)
- ✅ Subsequent operations execute after failures
- ✅ Queue continues processing after timeouts
- ✅ Mix of successful and failed operations all complete
- ✅ Queue integrity maintained with multiple failures

### 4. operationPromises Map Cleanup (7 tests)
- ✅ Map cleaned up after successful operations
- ✅ Map cleaned up after timeout errors
- ✅ Map cleaned up after retry exhaustion
- ✅ Map cleaned up for multiple concurrent operations
- ✅ Map cleaned up for mixed success/failure scenarios
- ✅ Map cleaned up when queue is cleared
- ✅ No memory leaks with many operations (100 operations tested)

### 5. Error Recovery and Queue Status (3 tests)
- ✅ Failed operations tracked in queue status
- ✅ Both successful and failed operations tracked correctly
- ✅ Error details available in failed operations

## Key Findings

### Memory Safety
All tests confirm that the `operationPromises` Map is properly cleaned up in every scenario:
- Success: Promise resolved, Map entry deleted
- Failure: Promise rejected, Map entry deleted
- Timeout: Promise rejected (via failure path), Map entry deleted
- Queue clear: All pending Promises rejected, Map entries deleted

### Error Propagation
Errors properly propagate to callers through Promise rejection:
- Timeout errors include operation ID and timeout duration
- Retry exhaustion errors include the original error message
- Queue clear errors indicate cancellation reason

### Queue Integrity
Failed operations don't block the queue:
- FIFO order maintained even with failures
- Subsequent operations execute after failures
- Queue status accurately tracks completed and failed operations

## Requirements Satisfied

This test suite satisfies all requirements from task 9:

✅ **5.1** - Error messages include operation type, ID, and failure reason  
✅ **5.2** - Timeout errors indicate timeout duration  
✅ **5.3** - Retry exhaustion errors indicate number of attempts  
✅ **5.4** - Failed operations don't block subsequent operations  
✅ **5.5** - operationPromises Map cleaned up after errors  

## Test Statistics
