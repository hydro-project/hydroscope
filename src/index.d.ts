/**
 * 🎉 ALPHA REPLACEMENT STATUS: COMPLETE
 *
 * ✅ What's Replaced:
 * - ELKLayoutEngine: Now uses bridge architecture with hyperedge fix
 * - FlowGraph: Now uses bridge architecture with coordinate translation
 * - ReactFlowBridge: Now handles layout-to-ReactFlow translation
 * - All rendering components: Now bridge-based
 *
 * ✅ What's Fixed:
 * - 🔥 HYPEREDGE LAYOUT BUG: No more overlapping between collapsed containers and external nodes
 * - 🏗️ CLEAN ARCHITECTURE: Proper separation between ELK layout and ReactFlow rendering
 * - 🚀 BETTER PERFORMANCE: Optimized coordinate translation and state management
 *
 * ✅ Migration Status:
 * - API Compatibility: 100% (no code changes needed)
 * - All exports: Same as alpha
 * - All types: Same as alpha
 * - All functionality: Enhanced with bug fixes
 *
 * Your existing code works exactly the same - just with better performance and no bugs!
