TASKS:
- clean up `npx tsc --noEmit`
- spinner covering up rendering
- efficiency of search on big files
- address overuse of `any`
- Centralize any stray constants
- MRTree tends to line up nodes vertically or horizontally (see first screenshot). The result is that lines occlude each other (see 2nd screenshot after I drag). Is there a way to convince MRTree to stagger the spacing so that it doesn't do that?
