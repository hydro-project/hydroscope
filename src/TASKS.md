TASKS:
- spinner covering up rendering
- MRTree tends to line up nodes vertically or horizontally (see first screenshot). The result is that lines occlude each other (see 2nd screenshot after I drag). Is there a way to convince MRTree to stagger the spacing so that it doesn't do that?
- consolidate tests
- sizing of intermediate containers
- cleanly remove upload/uploadEndpoint.js
