TASKS:
- enhance widgets in StyleTunerPanel to show the values of the settings, so I can copy them into config.ts
- DRY, clean up, check encapsulation of any index structure modifications
- Search/Graph Filtering/Focus: in treeview?
- Centralize any stray constants
- MRTree tends to line up nodes vertically or horizontally (see first screenshot). The result is that lines occlude each other (see 2nd screenshot after I drag). Is there a way to convince MRTree to stagger the spacing so that it doesn't do that?
