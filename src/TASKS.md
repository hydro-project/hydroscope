TASKS:
- spinner covering up rendering
- efficiency of rendering and esp. search on big files
- MRTree tends to line up nodes vertically or horizontally (see first screenshot). The result is that lines occlude each other (see 2nd screenshot after I drag). Is there a way to convince MRTree to stagger the spacing so that it doesn't do that?
- consolidate tests
